## Understanding Image Compression
Image compression reduces file size without heavily impacting quality.  
- **Lossless compression**: removes redundant data, keeps original quality.  
- **Lossy compression**: removes less noticeable details, smaller file size with minimal quality loss.  

This makes images faster to load, easier to share, and more storage‑friendly.

## Why Image Compression Matters
High‑resolution images from modern devices can be several MBs. Compression helps you:  
- Improve website speed and performance.  
- Save storage space locally and in the cloud.  
- Meet upload limits on apps and platforms.  
- Share images faster via messaging or social media.  
- Boost SEO by reducing page load times.
